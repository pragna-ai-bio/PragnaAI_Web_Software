## 🔬 Key Features

- 🧪 **Early Cancer Diagnosis Vision**  
  Utilizes **photoacoustic spectroscopy** to detect molecular-level changes in **lactic acid metabolism**, identifying cancer biomarkers earlier than traditional methods.

- 🤖 **AI-Powered Predictive Analysis**  
  A **multi-agent AI system** analyzes molecular vibration patterns to assess cancer probability with **interpretable reasoning** for medical professionals.

- 🏥 **Proactive Healthcare Intervention**  
  Enables **early-stage detection** and **proactive treatment**, improving patient outcomes and survival rates.

- 🌍 **Accessible Screening**  
  Focuses on making cancer detection **affordable, non-invasive, and globally accessible**.
